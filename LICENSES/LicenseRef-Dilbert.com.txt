    your use of the Web Site or activities in connection with the Web Site;
    your breach or anticipatory breach of these Terms;
    your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;
    information or material transmitted through your computer, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy or other right of any person or defames any person;
    any misrepresentation made by you; or
    the Andrews McMeel Syndication Parties' use of your information, content or submissions.

You will cooperate as fully required by the Andrews McMeel Syndication Parties in the defense of any claim. The Andrews McMeel Syndication Parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of a duly authorized employee of the Andrews McMeel Syndication Parties.

Termination and Suspension

Andrews McMeel Syndication may suspend and/or terminate your access to and use of the Web Site, in whole or in part, if Andrews McMeel Syndication believes you have failed to conform with these Terms. Andrews McMeel Syndication may do so in its sole discretion, without liability and without providing you with prior notice. Andrews McMeel Syndication may also investigate suspected violations of these Terms and may refer violations to law enforcement authorities.

If your access to this Web Site is suspended or terminated by Andrews McMeel Syndication, or Andrews McMeel Syndication otherwise asks, all rights granted to you under these Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will:

    immediately discontinue use of the Web Site and the Collaborative Content; and
    destroy all materials obtained from the Web Site and any related materials

The rights granted by you, and your agreements, obligations and covenants are not subject to termination, revocation or rescission.

Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration; Governing Law

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the United States and the State of New York governing contracts entered into and to be fully performed in the state of New York (i.e., without regard to conflict of laws provisions) regardless of your location. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to Andrews McMeel Syndication are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which will irreparably harm Andrews McMeel Syndication and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Andrews McMeel Syndication will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages (if any). Except with respect to the interpretation, protection or enforcement of Andrews McMeel Syndication’s claimed intellectual property rights or right to seek injunctive relief (which will only be subject to arbitration if the parties mutually agree), you agree that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or any of the transactions contemplated herein or any contests or services thereon (including, without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be resolved solely by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be held in Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois or New York, New York, whichever is closest to your place of residency. The arbitrator will apply the substantive laws of the State of New York, will issue a written decision, and will have the power to award any legal remedies consistent with this Agreement except for punitive, exemplary or special damages. The parties will split the arbitrator’s fee; provided, however, that if any court or arbitrator would find such requirement unconscionable or unenforceable, Andrews McMeel Syndication will have the option to pay all of such fees and proceed with arbitration. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s).
